This project is a fork of A2Billing.

99% of this code is all written by the A2Billing guys. I'm forking their project instead of 
working on it because I want to make large changes to A2Billing (I.E. writing the rate for a
call to the cdr instead of linking to the ratecard, dropping tons of features like sip and iax2
calls)

Is A3Billing a stupid name? Yes, yes it is.
